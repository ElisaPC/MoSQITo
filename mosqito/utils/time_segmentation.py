    Parameters
    ----------
    sig: numpy.array
        A 1-dimensional time signal array.
    nperseg: int, optional
        Length of each segment. Defaults to 2048.
    noverlap: int, optional
        Number of points to overlap between segments.
        If None, noverlap = nperseg / 2. Defaults to None.

    Returns
    -------
    block_array: numpy.array
        A 2-dimensional array of size (nperseg, nseg)
        containing the segmented signal.
