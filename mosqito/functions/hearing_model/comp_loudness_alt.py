def comp_loudness(signal, sb=2048, sh=1024):
    """Calculation of specific loudness and total loudness of an input signal according to ECMA-418-2. It describes the
    loudness excitation in a critical band per Bark. The output of the signal consists in a pair of array lists, one
    for specific loudness and the other one for total loudness.

    Parameters
    ----------
    validation: boolean
        Default value is set to 'False'. It is used to mark whether complete validation is done or not.

    signal: numpy.array
        'Pa', time signal values. It can be, stereo (2 dimensions) or mono (1 dimension).The sampling frequency of the
        signal must be 48000 Hz.

    Returns
    -------
    n_array: numpy.array
        'Sone per Bark'. It is a numpy array that is arranged as a matrix. Each matrix row represents a certain block of
        audio (in chronological order) and each matrix column stores the value of the specific loudness for that block
        and that specific band (column number). If the input signal is stereo, another matrix dimension is added.

    t_array: numpy.array
        'Sone per Bark'. As well as "n_array", it is a numpy array that is arranged as a matrix. Each matrix row
        represents a certain block of audio (in chronological order). If the input signal is stereo, another matrix
        dimension is added.
